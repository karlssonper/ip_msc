\subsection{Purpose}

Most image processing tasks are well-suited for parallel computing. The average image consists of millions of individual pixels. This is a very good case for GPU computing where a lot of the compute units can be utilized at the same time. 
\newline

As discussed in the previous chapter, there are different categories in image processing. This thesis will focus on the case where an input image is used to produce an output image.
